Format (Topic, Explanations, in Lists)

git commit -m
#1 Any git commit -m command must occur before git add. Without executing a git add command, messages are unable to be added by git commit -m. The system encourages & has limited commit messages to abide by the orderly process of git add, commmit, & push.

#2 Image elements were creatively used in this project. An image element without an image naturally creates a gap in between text. I used this gap to seperate bodies of text that spoke on different matters for the sake of legibility.

#3 I discovered that ordered lists do not look neat. They're too far to the right. In place of ordered lists, I therefore made use of paragraphs and made them appear as though they are ruled by ordered lists.
