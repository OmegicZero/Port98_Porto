            <h2>On Narrative Writing by Finn Gram Mertens</h2>
            <p><em>Ever dreamed of signing your life away to authorship?</em></p>
            <p><em>Perhaps you've had an imagination beyond your grasp.</em></p> 
            <p><em>Look no further. 
               Here are three principles every writer ought to know.</em><p>
                <img>
                <p><strong>1. Show & tell, respecitvely when you must</strong></p>
                <p>How can I show you something without telling you about it?</p>
                <p><strong>2. All nighters & coffee are your best friends</strong></p>
                <p>The silent hours of night are best lived energetically</p>
                <p><strong>3. Don't seek to appease a single reader</strong></p>
                <p>You'll exit the world the same way you entered</p>
                <p><strong>4. Cut off any filler words, any fat</strong></p>
                <p>Your favorite anime series should take this principle to heart</p>
                <p><strong>5. Strive not to finish, but obsess to edit your piece</strong></p>
                <p>Written pieces never are perfect, though imperfections make pieces human</p>
